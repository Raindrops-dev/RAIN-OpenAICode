# PowerShell Script for Automating ChatGPT API

This script is written to automate polling the OpenAI's GPT-3 API for the purpose of asking PowerShell commands. With this script, you can quickly get answers to your PowerShell questions without having to manually make API requests.

## How to Run the Script

1. Add your API key to a `openai.json` file based on the `openai.json.example` file.
2. Run the script with the `-Command` parameter to provide the command you'd like to request.

Example:

    .\Get-AIPowershellCommand.ps1 -Command "Command to list all permissions of a fileshare"
    Time to get a response from OpenAI: 18.4290256 seconds
   Your query was:
   Powershell script to scan recursively all subfolders of a network share and get the non-inherited permissions
   The response from OpenAI was:
   Get-ChildItem -Path \\network\share -Recurse | Get-Acl | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object { $_.IsInherited -eq $false }
   WARNING: Do you want to execute this command? [y/n]:
   Executing command...

This will return the result of the requested PowerShell command, as generated by the OpenAI API and it will ask you if you want to run it. Press y to run or n to not run.

Enjoy the convenience of having your PowerShell questions answered automatically!

P.S: Verify carefully before actually running any code it provides...
